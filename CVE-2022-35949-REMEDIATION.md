# CVE-2022-35949 Remediation Report

## Overview
This document outlines the remediation of CVE-2022-35949 and other security vulnerabilities found in the gallery_server project.

## CVE-2022-35949 Details
- **Vulnerability**: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in undici package
- **Affected Package**: undici 
- **Original Version**: 5.8.0 (vulnerable)
- **Fixed Version**: 5.28.6 (patched)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **CVSS Score**: 7.5
- **Advisory**: GHSA-8qr4-xgw6-wmr3

### Vulnerability Description
The `undici.request` function was vulnerable to SSRF attacks when using absolute URLs in the pathname parameter. This could allow attackers to make requests to internal services or bypass security controls.

### Code Impact
The vulnerability affects the `/uploadPath` endpoint in `app.js` at line 92:
```javascript
const response = await undici.request(parsedUrl.href);
```

While the application had some SSRF protections (hostname allowlist and private IP checks), the vulnerability in undici itself could potentially be exploited to bypass these protections.

## Additional Vulnerabilities Fixed

### Critical Vulnerabilities
1. **vm2 Package** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue**: Multiple sandbox escape vulnerabilities
   - **Action**: Replaced with `isolated-vm` 5.0.1
   - **Original**: vm2 ^3.9.3
   - **Replacement**: isolated-vm ^5.0.1

2. **minimist Package** (CRITICAL)
   - **Issue**: Prototype Pollution
   - **Action**: Updated to secure version
   - **Original**: 1.2.0
   - **Fixed**: ^1.2.8

### High Severity Vulnerabilities
1. **node-forge Package** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Multiple vulnerabilities including prototype pollution and cryptographic signature verification
   - **Original**: ^0.7.2
   - **Fixed**: ^1.3.1

2. **parse-url Package** (HIGH)
   - **Issue**: Authorization bypass
   - **Original**: ^6.0.5
   - **Fixed**: ^10.0.3

### Moderate Vulnerabilities
1. **jquery Package** (MODERATE)
   - **Issue**: Potential XSS vulnerabilities
   - **Original**: 3.4
   - **Fixed**: ^3.7.1

## Changes Made

### package.json Updates
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "undici": "^5.28.6",        // Fixed CVE-2022-35949
    "isolated-vm": "^5.0.1",    // Replaced vm2
    "minimist": "^1.2.8",       // Fixed prototype pollution
    "node-forge": "^1.3.1",     // Fixed multiple vulnerabilities  
    "parse-url": "^10.0.3",     // Fixed authorization bypass
    "jquery": "^3.7.1"          // Fixed XSS vulnerabilities
  }
}
```

### Application Code
- No application code changes were required
- The vm2 package was removed as it was not used in the application code
- All other packages are backward compatible with the existing code

## Verification
- All packages updated successfully
- `npm audit` reports 0 vulnerabilities
- Application tested and confirmed working
- undici updated from 5.8.0 to 5.29.0 (latest compatible version)

## Recommendations
1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to their latest stable versions  
3. **Security Headers**: Consider adding security headers to the Express application
4. **Input Validation**: The current SSRF protections are good, but consider additional validation
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for the `/uploadPath` endpoint

## Status
✅ **CVE-2022-35949 FIXED** - undici updated to 5.28.6+
✅ **All Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed**
✅ **Application Tested Successfully**
✅ **Zero Vulnerabilities Remaining**
